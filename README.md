# Purpose
This repo contains learning and research on blockchain & blockchain security. I saw [SEC554](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/blockchain-smart-contract-security/) and was interested in taking it, but I'm cheap (either that or they're expensive). So I decided to reference their syllabus for my own (free) research. The syllabus was NOT my own, but they make it available for the world so I used it to target my own research.
